#### Shipping Policy

Our goal is to ship all orders within 1-2 business days after receiving payment (excludes holidays). This includes any shipments that are drop shipped by our various vendors. If there will be a significant delay in your purchase, you will be contacted by a customer service representative to discuss alternate products or begin processing a full refund.

All orders containing hemp flower are professionally packaged including a “Notice to Law Enforcement” describing a legal hemp shipment along with a copy of the Certificate of Analysis for the products enclosed.

We ship products using legal methods via USPS/UPS, and tracking information will be provided to you once the shipment leaves our facilities. Once in transit via USPS/UPS, Elevated Trading cannot be held responsible for stolen orders, items lost in transit, undelivered items, or mistakenly seized items.
