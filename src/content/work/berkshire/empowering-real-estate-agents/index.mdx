            <strong> THE PROBLEM </strong> <br />
            The competition in real estate has gotten fierce over the last few years.
            Big disruptors, new business models, emerging technologies, and a new
            kid on the block, millennials. Not to mention the crash of 2008 which
            reshaped how a lot of people approach homeownership. These variables
            have all contributed to where we are today, savvier buyers and sellers,
            iBuyers — companies that use tech to make instant offers on homes, real
            estate agents fighting for their position in the transaction, and brokerages
            making bold moves. There's a lot to consider here, and it took me some
            time to really understand the landscape, trends, and forecasts for this
            market. But as designers, this fundamental understanding is critical
            to making meaningful contributions and adding value as quickly as we
            can.
            <br />

                technology that makes buying or selling a home delightful and

            Each brokerage had a specific system in place that they accredited
            to their success. These systems are complex and composed of
            third-party vendors, in-house tech, refined processes, marketing
            teams and much more.
            <br />
            <br />
            Additionally, the systems varied among real estate agents, real estate
            teams, and at the cornerstone of all this was the homeowner or seller.
            The number of inter-dependencies and overarching goals among the personas
            was incredible, we had a magnitude of work ahead of us.

            After several months of participating in our established sprint
            cycle, I identified an opportunity to increase velocity, alignment,
            and collaboration. While creating this proposal I drew inspiration
            from Google Design Sprints, LEAN UX design studios, and Invisions
            design sprints. Something to note is that this workshop was created
            to fill a gap in our product cycle, not as a replacement of a
            typical design sprint. The workshop aided in:
            <ul>
              <li>
                {' '}
                Contributing to the shared understanding of the design problem
                and the solution
              </li>
              <li>
                {' '}
                Identifying assumptions, constraints, and unknowns that could
                impact the success of the sprint
              </li>
              <li> Rallying teams around a design direction</li>
              <li> Creating high-level design artifacts</li>
              <li> Increasing the feeling of ownership across the team</li>
            </ul>
            After my team was successful in creating notable change in the areas
            above the workshops were adopted across other teams.

            Our entire process was organized around the LEAN methodology and
            validated learnings. This constant loop of user feedback would shape
            the product into something that was not only usable but also
            valuable. I conducted countless sessions that included:
            <ul>
              <li> Tree Testing to audit the information architecture</li>
              <li> Card Sorting to to pair with tree testing results</li>

            <strong> AUDITING THE CURRENT DESIGN LIBRARY </strong>
            <br />
            I had experience architecting a design library from my previous role
            at Gaugebox and would lead the efforts. This allowed me to quickly
            segment components and identify patterns in our design files. After
            a comprehensive audit, I was able to surface what our design
            language looked like across the site. The usual culprits were found
            such as color variants, excessive fonts, similar but different
            components, range CTA's, and others. From this high level view we
            identified a path forward for the design language.

            <strong> THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB </strong>
            <br />
            Axure was our tool of choice initially. It served us well for creating
            highly interactive prototypes which we used for user testing but it came
            at a high cost. Propagation. Changes made in one file would not propagate
            to files shared by the team. This immediately introduced fragmentation
            into our designs. I had worked exclusively with sketch up till point
            in my career so when I first noticed the lack of symbols, text styles,
            and palettes I was concerned. After a few presentations to the team we
            began testing several tools to replace Axure. Ultimately we landed on
            Figma.

            Initially this was intended to be an agent website. The website
            would mimic the functionality of the main brokerage site with
            opportunities for Agents to customize certain content. This got
            complicated fast from not a tech perspective but from the users
            experience. This was validated when we looked at the data, which
            showed that few agents were actually maintaining their websites, and
            usability tests with low success rates and NPS scores.
            <hr />
            After I conducted interviews with a number of Real Estate Agents to
            understand what the value of a website was. This turned out to be
            more of a percieved value though. Each brokerage offered it's agents
            a websites as a value prop to join their team. The agents would then
            be 100% responsible for maintaing that website with quality content,
            compelling calls to action, and lead management.
            <hr />I would then propose a portfolio solution. That would put their
            online presenece on auto pilot and free them to do more meaningful work.
            The beauty of the portfolio was that not only was a better solution for
            the agent but it also lowered tech overhead signficantly and allowed
            to focus and optimize one portfolio for all agents.

            Their would be wide range of content, roles, and permissions this
            needed to support. Additionally, we were allowing for multiple ways
            of editing content via a Live-editor or text editor. These multiple
            ways of editing was to support the two types of users that would use
            the CMS.
            <hr />
            <strong> TYPES OF EDITORS </strong> <br />
            We had the The "power user" persona, which was a Broker Admin who would
            be creating and managing all agents. The quick edit form would be ideal
            for this type of batch work.
            <hr />
            Then we had the Agents, who would want to make finer updates and test
            different types of images and text to optimize their profile. The Live-Editor
            gave them the opportunity to view these changes in real-time.
            <hr />
            <strong> INTERFACING WITH THE MLS </strong> <br />
            Their was one huge tech limitation in place. The fact that all the
            data we recieved for listings would be read only from each MLS. This
            meant that we would be able to fetch updates from the MLS but we
            couldn't write to it. That would get in the way of content
            syndication and require redundant updates in our CMS to update the
            new website content. I worked closely with engineering to understand
            how the MLS sync would work and then design around it.
