          This was a first at Weedmaps. I've had experience conducting these
          tests before so I was able to share some learnings with team and
          eventually provide enough rationale to get stakeholder buy in. I
          mention this because it required a bit of patience and advocacy to
          adopt this tool, as with most things research. Once that hurdle had
          been crossed we were up and running.

              10+ years of evolving the product and navigation to support user
              needs.
            </Body1>
          </Box>
          Weedmaps has been around for 10+ years and during that time it has
          created new surfaces (pages) to satisfy user needs. This meant we had
          very similar labels in our navigation that directed folks to the same
          place, just filtered differently. I'm not going to say redundancy is
          always a bad thing, a lot of navigations have success with
          poly-parenting of items, but that's usually at the subcategory level
          and not at the top of the heirarchy, so I had my concerns.
          <hr />
          <strong> COLLECTING A BASELINE </strong> <br />
          In my experience, writing unbiased and non-leading tasks are both the hardest
          part to this method and the easiest to get wrong. I leaned on SME's within
          the org across different functions to help draft tasks for the test. Afterwards,
          I paired down the list of tasks based on stakeholder feedback and would
          be ready to launch the test.
          <hr />
          I would then release the first test to 50 participants. The sample size
          was larger since this is a quantitative method. The larger sample size
          also helped with the initial skepticism some folks had for this method.

          The baseline test highlighted what we all kinda knew but never really
          knew how to quantify. We now had a clearer sense of which labels were
          causing the most confusion and could move to making a proposal.

          The team at WM has a very sophisticated data stack and I would only be
          scratching the surface of it. My goal was to go wide and look for
          anything that supported the confusion observed in the tree test.

          The new proposed tree would be doing just this, but what would that
          actually mean for the business? I set out to try and understand the
          implications of redistributing traffic from one destination on the
          site to the other. I partnered with data to check my logic and ended
          up using a simple formula of:
          <br />
          <code>
            % change in traffic = current nav clicks + (% change in tree test *
            current nav clicks)
          </code>

          <strong> IDENTIFYING A BIG BET </strong>
          <br />
          This was a great conversation starter and reminder of how valuable
          wayfinding is. I would share these insights in various meetings and
          channels until we aligned on a path forward. That path forward would
          be consolidation of certain pages. This was the "big bet" and would
          require several more months of planning before we could test.
          <hr />
          <strong> MOVING ON A SMALL WIN </strong>
          <br />
          The consolidation effort wouldn't yeild any returns for awhile since
          folks had to align on a few business goals before making a decision. I
          was still eager to demonstrate how valuable navigation can be and
          proposed a smaller quicker experiment. There was one point of data
          that stuck out to me.

              Desktop navigation engagement rates and mobile navigation rates
              were very similar.
            </Body1>
          </Box>
          This seemed very odd given that mobile sees about 90% of our traffic volume
          (9m-11m) and desktop only accounts for about 10% of traffic volume. Yet
          both had around 600k in navigation engagements per month. This suggested
          to me that navigation was valuable when exposed and not hidden away in
          a hamburger menu. The interaction cost of a hamburger menu was too high
          for people on mobile devices and I would aim to test it.

          <strong> MEASURING SUCCESS</strong>
          <br />
          Navigation plays such a profound role in almost in every journey that
          people take on the site and app that we had to scope what we would
          measure. We decided to keep it high level and then look to conduct an
          impact analysis after. For the experiment we would measure:
          <ul>
            <li> Navigation CTR </li>
            <li> Listing Page View </li>
            <li> Engagement Rate </li>
            <li> Promoted Engagements </li>
          </ul>
          <strong> EXPERIMENT RESULTS </strong>
          <br />
          Due to a hiccup in our data stack we had to pull the test after only 2
          days. We thought of relaunching the test test but our Data team
          determined we had enough data to make a decision.
          <ul>
            <li> +41% Navigation CTR </li>
            <li> +20% Listing page views </li>
            <li> +8% Engagement Rate </li>
            <li> +7% Promoted Engagements </li>
          </ul>
          The results were positive and supported the initial hypothesis. This
          gave us enough confidence to roll the feauture out to 100% of our
          audience on web. Once ramped to 100% is when we really started to
          observe how impactful this change was. The post impact analysis is
          shared above in the "Outcomes" section.
